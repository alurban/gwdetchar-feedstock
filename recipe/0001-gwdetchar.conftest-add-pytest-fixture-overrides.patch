+# these new fixtures overload the pytest builtin `tmpdir` and `tmp_path`
+# to ensure that the session is returned to the starting directory once
+# the test has finished (regardless of state).  This is a quick-fix to
+# address the fact that many existing tests execute `os.chdir(tmpdir)`
+# or similar, then run `shutil.rmtree`, leaving the session with a CWD
+# that doesn't exist.
